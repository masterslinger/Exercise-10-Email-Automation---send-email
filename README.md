## Aim
To create a UiPath workflow that sends an email using a Gmail account through SMTP or Outlook activities.

## Materials Required

UiPath Studio
Gmail account
Internet connection
Mail Activities package (installed by default)
Enable "Less secure apps access" or App Passwords in Gmail settings (if 2FA is enabled)

## Procedure

Step 1: Setup Gmail for SMTP Access
Enable 2-Step Verification on your Gmail account.
Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
Generate an App Password (e.g., for "Mail on Windows Computer"). 
Copy and save the app password securely — you’ll use it in UiPath.

Step 2: Create a New UiPath Process
Open UiPath Studio and create a new process named GmailSenderBot.

Step 3: Use Send SMTP Mail Message
Drag the Send SMTP Mail Message activity (found in UiPath.Mail.SMTP.Activities).

Fill in the properties:

Property	Value
To	"recipient@example.com"
Subject	"Test Email from UiPath"
Body	"Hello! This is a test email from UiPath automation."
Port	587
Server	"smtp.gmail.com"
Email	"your_email@gmail.com"
Password	Paste your Gmail App Password securely
SecureConnection	StartTls

Step 4: Run the Workflow
Save and run the bot.

The email will be sent to the recipient from your Gmail account.

## OUTPUT:
An email will be delivered to the recipient with the subject and message body specified.
